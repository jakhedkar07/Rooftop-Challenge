## Features

- **Dynamic Chart Loading**: Different visualization components (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, etc.) are loaded dynamically based on user selection.
- **State Management**: NgRx is used to manage application state, including data selections, current visualizations, and applied filters.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across different devices.
- **Customizable**: Users can select which data metrics to display and customize the color scheme.

## Technology Stack

- **Angular**: Frontend framework
- **NgRx**: State management
- **Angular Material**: UI components
- **ngx-charts**: Chart visualizations
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming

## Design Choices

### State Management with NgRx

NgRx was chosen for state management to handle:
- Tracking selected metrics
- Managing data loading states
- Persisting visualization preferences

### Dynamic Component Loading

The application uses a component-based architecture to dynamically load chart types:
- Each chart type is encapsulated in its own component
- A dynamic chart component serves as a wrapper, rendering the appropriate chart based on data type

### Responsive Design

The dashboard is built with a responsive approach:
- Flexible layout using Flexbox
- Breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Charts that resize based on available space

## Available Charts

- Bar Charts: For comparing values across categories
- Line Charts: For showing trends over time
- Pie Charts: For showing proportions of a whole
- Gauge Charts: For displaying performance metrics
- Advanced Pie Charts: For more detailed proportion views

## Running Tests

Run the following command to execute unit tests:

```bash
npm test
